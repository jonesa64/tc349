        <div id="wordsandstuff">
          <p>Kappa Alpha Psi , a college Fraternity, now comprised of
          functioning Undergraduate and Alumni Chapters on major campuses and in cities
          throughout the country, is the crystallization of a dream. It is the beautiful
          realization of a vision shared commonly by the late Revered Founders Elder
          Watson Diggs, "The Dreamer"; John Milton Lee ; Byron K. Armstrong; Guy Levis
          Grant; Ezra D. Alexander; Henry T. Asher; Marcus P. Blakemore; Paul W. Caine;
          Edward G. Irvin and George W. Edmonds.</p><br />

          <p>It was the vision of these astute men that enabled them in the
          school year 1910 - 11, more specifically the night of January 5, 1911, on the
          campus of Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana, to sow the seed of a
          fraternal tree whose fruit is available to, and now enjoyed by, college men
          everywhere, regardless of their color, religion or national origin. It is a
          fact of which KAPPA ALPHA PSI is justly proud that the Constitution has never
          contained any clause which either excluded or suggested the exclusion of a man
          from membership merely because of his color, creed, or national origin. The
          Constitution of KAPPA ALPHA PSI is predicated upon, and dedicated to, the
          principles of achievement through a truly democratic Fraternity.</p><br />

          <p>Chartered and incorporated originally under the laws of the
          State of Indiana as Kappa Alpha Nu on May 15, 1911, the name was changed to
          KAPPA ALPHA PSI on a resolution offered and adopted at the Grand Chapter in
          December 1914. This change became effective April 15, 1915, on a proclamation
          by the then Grand Polemarch, Elder Watson Diggs. Thus, the name acquired a
          distinctive Greek letter symbol and KAPPA ALPHA PSI thereby became a Greek
          letter Fraternity in every sense of the designation.</p><br />

          <p>From its inception, and for the next six years, Brother Diggs
          served as the Grand Polemarch of KAPPA ALPHA PSI Fraternity. Through his
          leadership and indefatigable application, augmented by the efforts of B.K.
          Armstrong, and John M. Lee, who comprised the remainder of the original Grand
          Board of Directors, the infant Fraternity was guided through the most perilous
          years of its life. Accordingly, much of the credit for the organization's
          survival through this period is shared by these three men.</p><br />

          <p>From its inception, every endeavor was directed toward
          establishing the Fraternity upon a strong foundation before embarking on plans
          of expansion. By the end of the first year, working together, Diggs and
          Armstrong had completed the ritual and had commenced work on the coat of arms.
          Work on the latter was completed during the following summer by Diggs,
          Armstrong and Lee while they were pursuing employment at a hotel in Fort Wayne,
          Indiana.</p><br />

          <p>In selecting a suitable motto, Diggs, Armstrong and Lee
          solicited the aid of a Professor of Greek Art at Indiana Technical College at
          Fort Wayne, Indiana. Having adopted a motto which mutually suited them, they
          carried a sketch of the coat of arms to a commercial engraver in Fort Wayne,
          from which he made the first metal plate.</p><br />

          <p>For years, in order to safeguard the ritualistic secrets of the
          Fraternity, Diggs laboriously typed and bound the rituals. It was not until he
          moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he met an old German printer in whom he
          had confidence, that he entrusted the esoteric materials of the Fraternity to a
          commercial printer.</p><br />

          <p>In the spring of 1912 Diggs wrote in a little blue examination
          book the first Constitution, which was adopted in 1920 with but a few
          revisions. This edition remained in use until 1926 when it was supplanted by
          the codified edition jointly written by Diggs, J. Ernest Wilkins, and W. Ellis
          Stewart. In 1957 the Constitution again underwent major revision.</p><br />

          <p>Now substantially established and provided with a Constitution,
          Ritual, coat of arms, motto, and guiding hand in a dynamic Grand Chapter, the
          Fraternity was ready for expansion. In the summer of 1912 Diggs visited the
          University of Illinois at Urbana, Illinois, where he met Earl B. Dickerson,
          President of the Old "Illini Club." This club constituted the nucleus of the
          University of Illinois Chapter, the Beta, which was chartered on February 8,
          1913. Gamma Chapter (later changed to Indianapolis Alumni Chapter) was
          established on December 29, 1913, followed by the establishment of Delta
          Chapter at the University of Iowa, on March 7, 1914. The latter was
          subsequently changed to Gamma Chapter, and the designation of Delta assigned to
          the Wilberforce University Chapter at Wilberforce, Ohio. Epsilon Chapter,
          Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, was established December 4, 1915, as the
          first chapter in the East. Elder W. Diggs journeyed from Indiana to give this
          chapter his personal and official installation, recognition and blessing.</p><br />

          <p>Thus ended the infancy of KAPPA ALPHA PSI, whereupon the
          Fraternity embarked upon an era of expansion. Except for the years of World War
          I and II, when several Grand Chapter meetings were suspended, KAPPA ALPHA PSI
          has grown and prevailed with unabating impetus.</p><br />

          <p>KAPPA ALPHA PSI Fraternity, relatively early, envisioned the
          modified attitudes of college administrators and administrations regarding
          certain frivolous activities previously identified with Greek letter
          organizations; and it initiated appropriate changes. Among the early changes
          brought about was the banning of paddling and other forms of physical abuse,
          and the introduction of constructive endeavors during pledgeship and probation.
          To date, KAPPA ALPHA PSI Fraternity is organizationally and administratively
          mature. It moves steadily toward a tomorrow of promise, productivity and
          influence.</p><br />
